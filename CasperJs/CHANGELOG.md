CasperJS Changelog
==================

2012-10-01, v1.0.0-RC2
----------------------

### Important Changes & Caveats

- **PhantomJS 1.6 is now the minimal requirement**, PhantomJS 1.7 is supported.
- CasperJS continues to ship with its own implementation of CommonJS' module pattern, due to the way it has to work to offer its own executable. While the implementations are nearly the same, **100% compatibility is not guaranteed**.

### Bugfixes & enhancements

2012-05-29, v0.6.9
------------------

- **BC BREAK:** PhantomJS 1.5 is now the minimal PhantomJS version supported.
- fixed [#114](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/114) - ensured client-side utils are injected before any `evaluate()` call
- merged [#89](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/pull/89) - Support for more mouse events (@nrabinowitz)
- [added a new `error` event, better error reporting](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/commit/2e6988ae821b3251e063d11ba28af59b0683852a)
- fixed [#117](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/117) - `fill()` coulnd't `submit()` a form with a submit input named *submit*
- merged [#122](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/pull/122) - allow downloads to be triggered by more than just `GET` requests
- closed [#57](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/57) - added context to emitted test events + complete assertion framework refactor
- fixed loaded resources array is now reset adequately [reference discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=fr?fromgroups#!topic/casperjs/TCkNzrj1IoA)
- fixed incomplete error message logged when passed an erroneous selector (xpath and css)

2012-05-20, v0.6.8
------------------

- added support for [XPath selectors](http://casperjs.org/#selectors)
- added `Tester.assertNotEquals()` ([@juliangruber](https://github.com/juliangruber))
- fixed [#109](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/109) - CLI args containing `=` (equals sign) were not being parsed properly

2012-05-12, v0.6.7
------------------

- fixes [#107](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/107): client utils were possibly not yet being injected and available when calling `Capser.base64encode()` from some events
- merged [PR #96](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/pull/96): make python launcher use `os.execvp()` instead of `subprocess.Popen()` ([@jart](https://github.com/jart)):
  > This patch fixes a bug where casperjs' python launcher process won't pass along kill
  > signals to the phantomjs subprocess. This patch works by using an exec system call
  > which causes the phantomjs subprocess to completely replace the casperjs parent
  > process (while maintaining the same pid). This patch also has the added benefit of
  > saving 10 megs or so of memory because the python process is discarded.
- fixes [#109](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/109) - CLI args containing `=` (equals sign) were not parsed properly

- **BC BREAK:**: moved the `page.initialized` event to where it should have always been, and is now using native phantomjs `onInitialized` event
- fixed [#95](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/95) - `Tester.assertSelectorExists` was broken

2012-03-28, v0.6.5
------------------

- **BC BREAK:** reverted 8347278 (refs [#34](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/34) and added a new `clear()` method to *close* a page
    You now have to call `casper.clear()` if you want to stop javascript execution within the remote DOM environment.
- **BC BREAK:** removed `fallbackToHref` option handling in `ClientUtils.click()` (refs [#63](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/63))

- added `--log-level` and `--direct` options to `casper test` command

------------------

- fixed [#41](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/41) - injecting casperjs lib crashes `cmd.exe` on Windows 7
- fixed [#42](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/42) - Use file name of test script as 'classname' in JUnit XML report (@mpeltonen)

2012-01-16, v0.6.1
------------------

- fixed casper could not be used without the executable [as documented](http://casperjs.org/#faq-executable)

- `Casper.open()` can now perform HTTP `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` and `HEAD` operations
- commonjs/nodejs-like module exports implementation
